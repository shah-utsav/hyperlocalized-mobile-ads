    <h1>Dynamic, Hyper-Local Mobile Advertising</h1>
    <p class="tagline">
      A next-generation advertising platform designed for autonomous and software-defined vehicles.
    </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project explores a new category of advertising that moves beyond static billboards and untargeted digital ads.
        The platform enables advertisements to be displayed dynamically on vehicles and updated in real time based on
        location, time, and nearby commercial activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        As vehicles become increasingly autonomous, they represent a growing network of mobile, always-on surfaces
        operating throughout cities. This venture is designed to sit at the software and data layer, matching advertisers
        with the right place and moment, rather than focusing on specific hardware implementations.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Local advertising today is inefficient and poorly targeted. Small and medium-sized businesses often spend money
        on static formats that reach large audiences but rarely the right ones. These ads are expensive to update,
        difficult to measure, and disconnected from real-world context.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, the advertising industry has not adapted to the rapid shift toward autonomous and
        software-driven vehicles. Despite strong insider signals that this transition is accelerating, there are
        currently no dominant platforms offering truly hyper-local, real-time advertising in the vehicle space.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p>
        This platform enables hyper-local, context-aware advertising that changes as vehicles move through different
        environments. Ads can be triggered based on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Proximity to nearby businesses or points of interest</li>
        <li>Time of day and local demand patterns</li>
        <li>Neighborhood-level demographic signals</li>
        <li>Predicted travel routes and dwell times</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This creates higher relevance for consumers, stronger return on ad spend for businesses, and a scalable
        advertising model aligned with the future of mobility.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Target Customers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Local and regional businesses seeking high-intent customer exposure</li>
        <li>Brands looking for city-level or neighborhood-level targeting</li>
        <li>Future mobility and fleet operators exploring new revenue streams</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Why Now</h2>
      <p>
        The transition toward autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles increases both the demand and supply for this
        type of advertising format. Vehicles are becoming more software-centric, spend more time operating in urban
        environments, and are increasingly integrated with real-time data systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Building this platform early allows the business to establish positioning, partnerships, and data advantages
        before the market becomes saturated.
