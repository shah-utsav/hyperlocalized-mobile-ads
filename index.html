    <h1>Dynamic, Hyper-Local Mobile Advertising</h1>
    <p class="tagline">
      Reimagining how advertising works in a world of software-defined and autonomous vehicles.
    </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Advertising has largely remained static while mobility has become dynamic. Billboards do not move.
        Flyers do not adapt. Most ads are locked to a location, even though people and vehicles are not.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project explores a new advertising paradigm: one where advertisements move with vehicles,
        update in real time, and respond to the environment they operate in. As cars become increasingly
        autonomous and data-driven, they represent a growing network of mobile, always-on surfaces
        distributed throughout cities.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Local advertising today is inefficient and misaligned with real-world behavior. Businesses often
        pay for exposure that is broad but poorly targeted, difficult to measure, and slow to update.
        Static formats dominate, even though consumer attention is highly contextual and location-dependent.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, the advertising industry has not meaningfully adapted to the rise of autonomous
        and software-defined vehicles. Despite clear momentum toward this future, there is no widely
        adopted platform that treats moving vehicles as intelligent, context-aware advertising surfaces.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p>
        This platform enables advertising that is dynamic, hyper-local, and responsive to the real world.
        Instead of locking ads to fixed locations, advertisements travel with vehicles and adapt continuously
        as those vehicles move through different neighborhoods, corridors, and points of interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        At its core, the solution treats mobility as a living data stream rather than a static asset.
        Advertisements are selected and displayed based on real-time context, such as where a vehicle is,
        where it is heading, and what types of businesses or activities exist nearby.
      </p>
      <p>
        This allows advertising to become:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>More relevant by appearing in locations where intent is naturally higher</li>
        <li>More adaptive by changing with time of day, traffic patterns, or local activity</li>
        <li>More efficient by reducing wasted exposure outside a business’s operating area</li>
        <li>More aligned with urban movement rather than fixed infrastructure</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Importantly, the platform is designed at the software and data layer. It is not dependent on any
        single display technology or vehicle type. This flexibility allows it to evolve alongside advances
        in mobility, autonomy, and connected vehicle systems.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Prospects</h2>
      <p>
        As cities grow denser and vehicles spend more time operating in urban environments, the demand for
        location-aware advertising will continue to increase. Local businesses are seeking better ways to
        reach customers nearby, while larger brands are looking for neighborhood-level visibility without
        relying on static infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        The gradual shift toward autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles further expands the opportunity.
        Vehicles that operate longer hours, follow predictable routes, or circulate without drivers
        naturally increase both the availability and effectiveness of mobile advertising surfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        This creates a growing space for platforms that understand movement, context, and locality at scale.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Long-Term Vision</h2>
      <p>
        The long-term vision is to establish a foundational layer for advertising in future mobility
        ecosystems. As vehicles become autonomous, connected, and increasingly integrated into city
        infrastructure, advertising should evolve from static placements to intelligent, responsive systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this future, ads are not just displayed — they are aware of where they are, when they appear,
        and why they matter in that moment. Vehicles become part of a broader urban communication network,
        delivering information that is timely, local, and relevant without overwhelming the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is an early step toward that future.
